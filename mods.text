planned mods to implement:

(60) replace/change ui and sprites all to a different theme.
    - either fantasy or feeding hippos/alligators in a river from a boat or cowboys shooting bandits (with parallax scrolling)

(30)(MAYBE) implement simultaneous 2 player mode
    - compete to see who can feed more gators/kill more whatevers
    - either both on the same side or opposing sides
